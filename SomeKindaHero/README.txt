Issues: 
- I moved while I was doing this assignment on top of which I was also 
unpacking from moving everything out from my dorm room. Time was rather limited.
- I was basing alot of function on Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition, only to realize with such 
limited time many of the more complex mechanics I wanted to include and had to reapproach the idea
- The block mechanic works 1/2 of the time it seems and I haven't been able to determine why it is a
flip of the coin on that mechanic.


Notes: 
- I definately will be doing this more in my free time. I enjoyed trying to map everything out 
and it would be neat to experience the careful electronic planning for D&D 5e mechanics
